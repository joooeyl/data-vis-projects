# data-vis-projects
cmsc 23900

These are my most memorable projects for my University of Chicago Data Visualization class (CMSC 23900). Project 2 was a recreation of the famous Nightingale visualization, and Project 3 was a colormap of US Presidential electrion data. All projects were done with Javascript/HTML/CSS with base code provided by my professor.
